# Darts Competition Results Service

This is a Python program for managing the results of a darts competition. The program allows you to start a new competition, load an existing competition, save results, and add scores for participants.

## Features

The program's main menu offers the following options:

- `n`: Start a new competition
- `l`: Load an existing competition
- `s`: Save the competition
- `p`: Display the competition results
- `i`: Add a new participant and their score
- `q`: Exit the program

### Note

- All variables & functions are named and the results service itself is written in Finnish.
- Competition data is saved and loaded as a `.txt` file, with the name provided by the user.
